The idea would be as follows: 

-  Goal: Given a text, find its author. Relevant when the text is unclassified due to historical reasons (e.g. Shakespeare <-> Cervantes). Also,
very useful for knowing the features of this author (epoch, style, nationality...)

-  Test: Find using a neural network the relation between the person that has written a certain text (observing its characteristics)

-  Training: With a varied and large database, which will be labelled (assigned) to their actual authors, train the network.

Obviously, test and training texts would not be the same. Thereby, we need to learn how each author writes.
