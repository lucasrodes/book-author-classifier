as literature, and a suggestive bibliography of articles about this comedia. A more recent edition is
that prepared by Everett W. Hesse and published in New York by Dell in 1964.
A translation of the play AThe Lady Nit-Wit@ was prepared by William Oliver and published
in Tempe by The Bilingual Review Press in 1995
La dama boba has also been the subject of many studies that have been published since these
two editions were prepared. These items may be identified by reference to the valuable
ABibliography on the Comedia@ published each fall in the Bulletin of the Comediantes.
Several performances of La dama boba have been filmed and preserved on video and are
available on loan from the AHCT. You may want to consult the catalog of those holdings by
connecting to <www.comedias.org> and then following the links to the ACatalog of the Video Tape
