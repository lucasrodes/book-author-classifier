prepared by J. M. Ruano de la Haza and J. E. Varey and published in London by Támesis in 1980.
This edition should be easily found in any reasonable university library. In it you will also find a
bibliography of early editions and manuscripts available for the play, cogent discussion of the work
as literature, and a suggestive bibliography of articles about this comedia.
Peribáñez has also been the subject of many studies that have been published since this
edition was prepared. These items may be identified by reference to the valuable ABibliography on
the Comedia@ published each fall in the Bulletin of the Comediantes.
Two reasonably reliable translations of this play exist: Peribáñez as translated by J. M. Lloyd
and published by Ariz and Phillips in Warminster in 1990; and that translated by Walter Starkie and
published in Eight Spanish Plays of the Golden Age, by Random House in New York in 1964.
