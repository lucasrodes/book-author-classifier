Lope de Vega
LA DAMA BOBA
This edition of the play is intended to be a reliable edition but is, under no circumstances, to
be considered as a thorough critical edition complete with variant readings, extensive notes, nor any
of the valuable expository discussion that is usually found in such. Those who would like to study
the play or to comment on it with greater security than can be claimed for this electronic edition
should refer to a critical edition of the work such as that prepared by Rudolph Schevill and published
in Berkeley by the University of California Press in 1918 [The Dramatic Art of Lope de Vega...].
This edition should be easily found in any reasonable university library. In it you will also find a
bibliography of early editions and manuscripts available for the play, cogent discussion of the work
as literature, and a suggestive bibliography of articles about this comedia. A more recent edition is
that prepared by Everett W. Hesse and published in New York by Dell in 1964.
A translation of the play AThe Lady Nit-Wit@ was prepared by William Oliver and published
in Tempe by The Bilingual Review Press in 1995
La dama boba has also been the subject of many studies that have been published since these
two editions were prepared. These items may be identified by reference to the valuable
ABibliography on the Comedia@ published each fall in the Bulletin of the Comediantes.
Several performances of La dama boba have been filmed and preserved on video and are
available on loan from the AHCT. You may want to consult the catalog of those holdings by
connecting to <www.comedias.org> and then following the links to the ACatalog of the Video Tape
Collection of the AHCT.
