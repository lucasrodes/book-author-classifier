Lope de Vega
PERIBÁÑEZ Y EL COMENDADOR DE
OCAÑA
This edition of the play is intended to be a reliable edition but is, under no circumstances, to
be considered as a thorough critical edition complete with variant readings, extensive notes, nor any
of the valuable expository discussion that is usually found in such. Those who would like to study
the play or to comment on it with greater security than can be claimed for this electronic edition
should refer to one of the modern critical editions of the work: the most reliable of these is that
prepared by J. M. Ruano de la Haza and J. E. Varey and published in London by Támesis in 1980.
This edition should be easily found in any reasonable university library. In it you will also find a
bibliography of early editions and manuscripts available for the play, cogent discussion of the work
as literature, and a suggestive bibliography of articles about this comedia.
Peribáñez has also been the subject of many studies that have been published since this
edition was prepared. These items may be identified by reference to the valuable ABibliography on
the Comedia@ published each fall in the Bulletin of the Comediantes.
Two reasonably reliable translations of this play exist: Peribáñez as translated by J. M. Lloyd
and published by Ariz and Phillips in Warminster in 1990; and that translated by Walter Starkie and
published in Eight Spanish Plays of the Golden Age, by Random House in New York in 1964.
