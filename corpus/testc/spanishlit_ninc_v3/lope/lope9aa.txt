Lope de Vega
LA DAMA BOBA
This edition of the play is intended to be a reliable edition but is, under no circumstances, to
be considered as a thorough critical edition complete with variant readings, extensive notes, nor any
of the valuable expository discussion that is usually found in such. Those who would like to study
the play or to comment on it with greater security than can be claimed for this electronic edition
should refer to a critical edition of the work such as that prepared by Rudolph Schevill and published
in Berkeley by the University of California Press in 1918 [The Dramatic Art of Lope de Vega...].
This edition should be easily found in any reasonable university library. In it you will also find a
bibliography of early editions and manuscripts available for the play, cogent discussion of the work
